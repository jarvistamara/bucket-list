# REACT BUCKET LIST APPLICATION
    For my second project at [FLATIRON SCHOOL](https://flatironschool.com/), I used an internal database to allow the user to populate their Bucket List Todos .

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
    I used the following programming languages:
    - REACT JSX
    - JAVASCRIPT
    - CSS
## HOW TO USE
    On start-up you will see a Home Page that describes the application. There are two routes at the Navigation. One is the Home Page and the other allows you to view all of the items on the bucket list. On the Items page, we can see other items and/or add new items via the new item button. Once clicked, you will be routed to the bucket list form where you will add your new bucket list item.
